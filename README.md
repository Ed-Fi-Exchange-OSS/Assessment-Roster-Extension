# Ed-Fi-X-AssessmentRoster
This is a repository to store Assessment Roster source code and other artifacts

The EdFiXAssessmentRoster extension is intended to capture and communicate data surrounding the expectation that a student will take an assessment. This extension does not model the actual administration of the assessment nor does it model the reporting of the results.
