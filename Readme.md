# Assessment-Roster-Extension

This is a repository to store Assessment Roster source code and other artifacts

The EdFiXAssessmentRoster extension is intended to capture and communicate data
surrounding the expectation that a student will take an assessment. This
extension does not model the actual administration of the assessment nor does it
model the reporting of the results.
